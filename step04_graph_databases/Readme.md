  - Relational Database

    - In relational database there are tables and each table is connected to other table using foreign keys. In order to do a query we join tables using foreign key. Relational databases are nor scaleable enough and they are not suitable for internet scale applications.

  - noSQL database

    - To overcome the issue of scalabilty with relational datbase noSQL databases were developed where complete row is stored as a single entity but it lost the connection between different data items.

  - Graph Database
    - In modern applications data is interconnected and that is the reason for Graph databases.
    - A graph database uses highly inter-linked data structures built from nodes, relationships, and properties.
